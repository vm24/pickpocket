python pickpocket.py
Monitoring Starts:
The script will continuously monitor the mouse, keyboard, and charger activity, sending updates to your Telegram account. To stop the monitoring, press Ctrl+C.

Telegram Notifications:
Whenever a mouse movement, key press, or charger event occurs, you'll receive an instant notification on your Telegram account.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Telegram Notifications:
All messages (mouse movements, key presses, charger events) will be sent to your Telegram. You can easily customize the message format by editing the send_message() function in the script.

Polling Interval:
The script uses asyncio to handle multiple tasks. You can adjust the frequency or the data captured by modifying the polling functions within the script.

üßë‚Äçüíª Code Walkthrough
Mouse and Keyboard Listener:
Uses the pynput library to capture real-time mouse movements and key presses. Each event triggers a notification.

Charger Monitoring:
Uses the psutil library to detect when the charger is plugged in or unplugged, and sends a message accordingly.

Telegram Integration:
Utilizes the telethon library to send messages to your Telegram account. The bot runs asynchronously, sending updates whenever an event occurs.

üì∏ Webcam Snapshot (Optional)
If you'd like the script to send webcam snapshots with each event, you can easily integrate a webcam capture function into the existing workflow. We can modify the script to capture and send images from your webcam using libraries like opencv-python.

üîß Troubleshooting
Missing Dependencies:
If you encounter issues with missing libraries, try running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Make sure all necessary dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.)

Telegram Bot Not Responding:
Ensure that the bot token and user ID are correctly set in the script. If issues persist, check if Telegram API services are up and running.

Event Listener Issues:
If you experience issues with the event listeners (e.g., key presses or mouse movements not being detected), make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the script and access your hardware resources.
